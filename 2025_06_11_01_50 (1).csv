I have studied the events of history back to the British Archives and early European Trade, andeven though the institutions, market technology, use of leverage, degree of financialization, and composition of market actors and types of market players and where they hide out, have evolved,there is one constant that has never changed, namely, the thinking frameworks that are constrained to binary logic,which fail to organically address uncertainty as the landscape instead of the ambient noise and negative space.I have developed an anti-fragile research framework, instantiated by a Sentiment-Aware innovation, called Momentum Perception Maps, for making better sense of complex non-linear financial systems, andthe hidden changes in the  inter-market financial wiring and market structures, that are inherently driven by uncertainty, and rather gaining from it.This framework sees regularity as a diseased state, and long-tailed uncertainty and volatility as the background radiation that serves as the power source of tomorrow's panics and manias.By bringing the human observer into the decision-making equation, instead of following classical principles, andnot making the false assumption that the composition of market actors observing the trends of today are the same ones that created them,my mission is to:help investors raise their anxiety-adjusted returns in all market environments, andlevel the playing field between reported financial product and fund manager performance and realized individual investor returns.Leaping beyond the failures of behavioral finance, I founded Running Alpha for developing alternative performance indices, that add a new level of transparency into the Alpha drivers,so that investors can be continuously engaged in building trust in their outcomes, instead of being spooked by uncertainty and wild market swings.Among the many things I do at Running Alpha better than my industry peers, that few focus on, is:capturing sentiment regime changes and subtle market anomalies ahead of Momentum Crashes, Extreme Reversion, and Trend-Continuation Events, andmaking it my business to utilize this new scientific investment research framework for scrutinizing the market actor states in dark and lit markets,that will trigger the onset of action-reaction feedback cycles, amplifying the market impact of incoming positive and negative news sentiment.By ranking assets based on how antifragile their responses will be to the news cycle,traders and investors can choose assets that will make it remarkably less likely that they will hit the panic button and ditch a strategy at just the wrong moment.By monitoring how favorably these select assets respond to the news cycle relative to lower ranked anti-fragile alternatives,investors can stay engaged between monthly and quarterly reporting intervals,with many statistically significant data points, that will enable investors to build trust in the alpha input drivers,instead of simply gaining a false confidence in a few data points outputs that only express the outcome of a decision,without having knowledge whether it was dumb luck that put them in the right market regime.Serving as Global Macro Strategist of Running Alpha, I have an unwavering passion for communicating and explaining away complex ideas in actionable ways,that make people -- both small and large audiences walk away without hitting the panic button,but rather inspired to seize the opportunity of the moment with a prepared and satisfied mind.A few use cases I am currently pursuing are providing alternative intelligence on timing corporate stock buybacks, takeover opportunities, and corporate news releases,for Fortune 500 companies and liquid publicly traded U.S. equities --for saving firms Billions of Dollars on poorly timed corporate investment and media events, particularly when the matrix of market player perception biases are in the wrong sentiment state.",,"Toronto, Ontario, Canada",,,+12024185080,,,,,"Founder and CEO -- Financial Tornado Chaser and Global Macro Strategist",
